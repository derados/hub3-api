# HUB-3 Barcode API

A simple API for generating 2D barcodes according to the HUB-3 standard.

![Sample HUB-3 barcode](/static/barcode.png)

## The standard

HUB-3 is a payment slip format used by Croatian banks and published by the
[Croatian Banking Association](http://www.hub.hr/). It also defines a way
to encode this data as a 2D barcode in
[PDF417 format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417).

You can find out more about the HUB-3 Barcode standard
[here](http://www.hub.hr/hr/hub3-obrasci) (Croatian, PDF).

This barcode is often printed on HUB-3 payment slips and many banking
applications can scan and process such barcodes.
